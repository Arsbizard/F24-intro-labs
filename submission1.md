# Task 1: SSH Commit Signature Verification
Signed commits help ensure the authenticity and integrity of commits.
They verify that a commit comes from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.
## Benefits of Signing Commits
1. **Author Verification**: Confirms the identity of the commit author.
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensures the commit has not been altered since it was signed.
3. **Trust in Collaboration**: Builds confidence in projects with multiple contributors.
4. **Security**: Prevents unauthorized commits or identity impersonation.
5. **Compliance**: Helps meet audit and regulatory requirements.
